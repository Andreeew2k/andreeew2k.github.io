                WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE 
====================================================

Welcome, traveler. You have chosen — or perhaps been 
chosen — to explore one of the finest websites I have 
ever assembled. 

I thought so highly of this site that I decided to 
host my resume and projects here. And so, whether you 
are here to stay or just passing through on your way 
to parts unknown... WELCOME.

║   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)          ABOUT ME           ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hi! My name is Andrii Lenyshyn. I am a graduate 
student with 3+ years of academic and industry HCI 
experience.

A little bit "formal" about me:
- On my way toward a PhD in Computer Science @ UofT
- Proud member of the CHAI Lab
- Currently on a leave of absence for an industry 
  role as a UX Researcher @ McAfee

A little bit "informal" about me:
- I like to take take pictures with my old film camera:
Canon Rebel G II 35mm SLR
- One of my life goals is to visit each country!
- I enjoy good belgian beer, and even brew some small
batches at home:)

This is a simple Windows XP–inspired desktop replica — 
a vibecoded tribute to the glow of CRT monitors and 
my first steps into the world of computers & science.

Behind these icons you’ll find the goods:

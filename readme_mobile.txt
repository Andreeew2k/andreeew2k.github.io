     WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE
================================

Welcome, traveler.

You have chosen — or perhaps been 
chosen — to explore one of the 
finest websites I’ve ever 
assembled.  
I thought so highly of this site 
that I decided to host my resume 
and projects here.

And so, whether you're here to 
stay or just passing through 
on your way to parts unknown...

WELCOME.

This site is a Windows XP–
inspired desktop replica — 
a vibecoded tribute to the glow 
of CRT monitors and my first 
steps into the world of CS.

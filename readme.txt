               WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE
====================================================

Welcome, traveler. You have chosen — or perhaps been 
chosen — to explore one of the finest websites I have 
ever assembled. 

I thought so highly of this site that I decided to 
host my resume and projects here. And so, whether you 
are here to stay or just passing through on your way 
to parts unknown... WELCOME.

This is a simple Windows XP–inspired desktop replica — 
a vibecoded tribute to the glow of CRT monitors and 
my first steps into the world of computers & science.
